# Transfer-Hospital-Data-from-Excel-tables-to-Website
Project Date: WINTER 2022<br>
# Project Description
There is a hospital's statistical data in several Excel tables, with each table saved in a text file using comma-separated values (CSV) file format. The task was to design and implement a Java tool to read and process CSV files and create the corresponding HTML tables in a HTML webpage. The challenge was processing rows with missing attributes or data. I designed and implemented a program to transfer the contents of the Excel tables to the hospitalâ€™s website in a best way possible.
